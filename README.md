# ShapeShifter

This repo covers the prototype and tools for ShapeShifter.

## Tools for Lambda Enforcer and Kubernetes integration

### System prerequisite

For running the tools here, you can directly run them on your Linux server, 
since we only required the `tc` command. 
It is recommended to run in your MEC Kubernetes testbed.

The instruction of our MEC testbed is covered as following:
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/GTkernel/kubernetes-cluster-deployment): with the CNI, WeaveNet.
* vRAN, the LTE testbed by [NextEPC](https://github.com/GTkernel/nextepc)'s core network; 
and [SrsRAN](https://github.com/GTkernel/srsRAN)'s eNB and UE.
